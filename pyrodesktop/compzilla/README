About Pyro
==========

Pyro is a desktop environment for Linux built on Mozilla Firefox. 
At the core, Pyro is a windowing system which richly integrates the 
capabilities of modern Web Sites with existing native applications.

Pyro creates a Web-based desktop by drawing your entire screen as a 
Web Page. Using the trusted Mozilla Add-On system, all the capabilities 
of dynamic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are exposed to enable incredible 
extensions and themes. Using the newest generation of Linux display 
technology, called window compositing, Pyro deftly handles native 
applications as a regular part of the Web Desktop. 

The Pyro Desktop homepage can be found at http://pyrodesktop.org.
